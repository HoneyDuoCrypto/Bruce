# 🤝 Claude Session Handoff - Technical Deep Dive

**Generated:** 2025-06-10 03:17:46
**Session ID:** session_20250610_031746
**Project:** Honey Duo Wealth Project Management System

## 🎯 Mission Briefing

You're joining development of a **multi-phase project management system** designed for seamless Claude session handoffs. The system tracks tasks across phases, auto-generates documentation, and preserves context between sessions.

## 📊 Current Development Status

**Overall Progress:** 7/10 tasks (70.0%)

### ✅ What's Been Built
- **scaffold-repo:** Initialize project directories and placeholder files → `Empty dirs: docs/, src/, cli/, pipelines/, infra/, tests/`
- **cli-prototype:** Implement CLI commands: start, status, commit-hook integration → `Executable hdw-task script with basic command parsing`
- **hello-world:** Create a simple hello world function → `hello_world() function in src/utils.py`
- **pm-multi-phase:** Update task manager to load from phases/*.yml files → `src/task_manager.py with multi-file support`
- **pm-phase-progress:** Add phase progress calculation and display → `Progress tracking per phase`
- **pm-blueprint-gen:** Auto-generate blueprint from completed tasks → `src/blueprint_generator.py`
- **pm-web-phases:** Update web UI to show phase-based progress → `hdw_complete.py with phase views`

### 🔄 What You're Continuing
- **pm-context-enhance:** Include related tasks and decisions in context → `Enhanced context generator`


## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### Core Components
```
TaskManager (src/task_manager.py)
├── Manages multi-phase task loading from YAML files
├── Handles context file generation and organization  
├── Tracks progress across phases
└── Integrates with CLI and Web UI

CLI Interface (cli/hdw-task.py)
├── Enhanced with blueprint auto-generation
├── Supports phase-aware task management
├── Triggers git operations and documentation
└── Generates Claude handoff reports

Web Dashboard (hdw_complete.py)  
├── Phase-aware progress tracking
├── RESTful API for task operations
├── Visual task management interface
├── Blueprint Generator integration
└── Integrated Claude report generation

BlueprintGenerator (src/blueprint_generator.py)
├── Analyzes system architecture automatically
├── Creates comprehensive technical blueprints
├── Maps component connections and data flows
└── Generates session handoff documents
```

## 🚀 How to Continue Development

### Immediate Commands
```bash
# Check current system status
python cli/hdw-task.py status

# See what tasks are available
python cli/hdw-task.py list

# Start a specific task
python cli/hdw-task.py start <task-id>

# Test blueprint generation
python src/blueprint_generator.py update --phase-id 1
```

### Web Interface
- **URL:** http://hdw.honey-duo.com
- **Login:** hdw / HoneyDuo2025!
- **Features:** Phase tracking, task management, blueprint generation

### Development Workflow
1. **Pick a pending task** from the list above
2. **Start the task** to generate context file
3. **Implement the required output** 
4. **Commit the task** - triggers auto-blueprint generation
5. **Generated blueprints** appear in `docs/blueprints/`

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

### Priority Tasks
- **pm-context-enhance:** Include related tasks and decisions in context


### Success Metrics
- ✅ Any Claude session can pick up work immediately  
- ✅ System generates comprehensive technical blueprints
- ✅ Architecture connections are clearly mapped
- ✅ Documentation stays current automatically

---

**🚀 Ready to continue development!** The system is designed to support you with context, documentation, and clear next steps.
